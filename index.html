          For the drawing app, I partnered with Ian Zambrano to create multiple
          versions of our app to include the ability to draw, create different
          shapes, asterisks, flowers, and other tools. Our goal was to make a
          functioning drawing app that effectively created shapes where size was
          adjustable. We faced many problems with how to center the shapes, so
          once drawn, they were perfectly centered where the mouse originally
          was. I learned that Snap Berkeley has a variety of libraries that can
          be downloaded and used to create animations in our coding app, provide
          a variety of colors to draw with, and create menus to choose different
          tools. Although this is a work in progress, we will continue to make
          new versions to improve our drawing app.

          I based my Scratch Game on a cat cafe where you control the cat paw to
          collect the falling boba. My first idea included coding an entire cafe
          game where the player was able to make different drinks for customers.
          However, with many complications and my minimal knowledge on coding, I
          decided to make my game more simple. I was inspired by a YouTube video
          by fluffkeys who had a similar cafe style game. To make it my own, I
          made it into a cat boba cafe where the player is the cat paw who
          catches falling boba for their matcha boba drink. I ended up learning
          how to add different components to my game to make it more enticing
          such as background music that changed from the start to the end,
          different backgrounds with a congratulating ending scene, and the
          ability for your score to be tracked based on how much boba the paw
          collected. This all contributed to my preliminary knowledge of coding
          and acted as a formal introduction to it.

          This is a project that lasted an entire school year where I worked on
          deciding a research topic, planning a procedure on how to collect my
          data, then executing my research by interviewing around 10 students
          that aligned with my targeted population. In the end, I encountered
          the most challenges with forming my research procedures and finding
          the most efficient way to collect my data. I ended up using both
          quantitative and qualitative means of data collection that was then
          combined to support one another in my conclusion. There were
          scheduling conflicts between the interviews and I also had to create
          questions that were unique to each student, but in the end I learned
          how to manage my time, compile data into a research paper, and work on
          my public speaking skills since our final was a thorough presentation
          on our research. This class acted as a base that helped improve my
          writing skills and my ability to formulate instantaneous responses.
